Garden
====

## Overview

**Garden** is a straightforward asynchronous task management library for Python. It is ideal for all uncomplicated tasks that do not require a task dependency system. It performs exceptionally well for tasks that are simple and small in nature, asynchronous, require repetition or dispatching, and can pause when certain conditions are met. For instance, tasks such as data crawling and extractions.
